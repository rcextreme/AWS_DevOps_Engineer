  IV.II Version Control
    reference  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/specifying-your-aws-credentials.html
    Set up AWS Code Commit
    -view AWS-> CodeCommit -> UserGuide -> SetUp
    -Install AWS Tools for Windows Powershell
    -Install git for windows
    -Unselect Git Cred mngr. because I'm  going to use a cred manager
     that comes with the AWS tools so I can authenticate to AWS CodeCommit
    -Create a codecommit user in your AWS account and save the credentials
       Add CodeCommit access policy to this user
    -Add credentials to powershell
      > Set-AWSCredentials -AccessKey <key_id> -SecretKey <key_value> -StoreAs codecommit
      > cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\AWS Tools\CodeCommit'
      > .\git-credential-AWSS4.exe -p codecommit

    -Create a repo in CodeCommit
    -Clone the repo in PowerShell
       git clone https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyRepo

    -Check in a file
      > git config user.email 'raf@example.com'
      > git config user.name 'raf'
      > notepad index.html
      > git status

      > git add .\index.html
      > git status
      > git commit -m 'initil commint'

      > git log
      > git diff <commit_id>
      > get-history   <view history in powershell>
      > Invoke-History 25



  IV.III Getting started with CodeDeploy and CodePipeline
  
     Project's repo  https://github.com/mikepfeiffer/aws-codedeploy-jenkins-linux

     Create  IAM roles :
      CDInstanceRole -> service role: EC2  -> AmazonEC2RoleForCodeDeploy
      CDServiceRole -> servicerole: CodeDeploy -> AWSCodeDeployRole

   Deploy two ec2 instances
        assign the CDInstanceRole
        
        bootstrap:
        #!/bin/bash
        cd /home/ec2-user/
        aws s3 cp 's3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/latest/codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm' . --region us-east-1
        yum -y install codedeploy-agent.noarch.rpm

    Set up App and Deployment Group in CodeDeploy
      CodeDeploy -> Custom Deployment
          AppName: DemoApp
          DepGroupName: DemoAppInstance
          search by tags: Dev
          Deployment Config: AllAtOnce
          ServiceRole: CDServiceRole

    Setup a two stage Apps pipeline to deploy the App
        CodePipeline -> New
           name: pipeline
           SourceProvider: Github
           Connect to Github (it'll leverage single sign on if you're signed on already)
             Select Repo, Branch: master
             Build Provider: no
             Dep Provider: AWS Code Deploy
             App Name: Demo App
             Depl.Group: DemoAppInstances
             Create Service Role: AWS-CodePipeline-Service


    Deploy tw EC2 instances: T2Micro with CDInstanceRole
      Add Boostrap script



  IV.IV Build a pipeline with  a Build Stage
     This video implements this tutorial:  
                 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/tutorials-four-stage-pipeline.html

    Continuous Integration products
    -Bamboo from Atlassian
    -TeamCity from JetBrains
    -Travis CI
    -CruiseControl
    -Jenkins, CodePipeline integrates nicely with this product

    CI servers vs Build Tools

    In this section we'll
    -Run Jenkins on EC2
    -Create a new code pipeline with build and test stages

    New Project we'll use: AWS CodeDeploy Jenkins Linux
    -Rake will generate the index.html file

    Go back into CodePipeline and delete the previous PL

    From Mike's Github account, Download the CloudFormation template to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance
   
    Build the Jenkis server using the provided CloudFormation template
      AWS -> CloudFormation
      -stack name: jenkins
      -instance type: t2.micro
      -KeyName:
      -VPC ID:
      -VPC subnet
      -Your IP Range: 0.0.0.0/0
      - DON'T TAG
      
      Once build complete, Connect to URL of Jenkins server and configure it
        -Get password from server: cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
        -Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security -> Enable Security
        - Jenkins own user database, Allow users to sign up
        - Manage pluggins -> 
          -Install : AWS CodePipeline
          -restart jenkins app server
        - Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Properties -> Environment Variables
          -Add Env variables so Jenkins can find the Rake utility
             name: PATH
             Value: $PATH:/usr/local/bin
       
      - Create a new project in Jenkins 
            Jenkins -> Dashboard -> New Item -> 
            Name: Build Project
            Freestyle project ->  oK
            
            Execute Concurrent builds if necessary
            Source Code Mngt: AWS CodePipeline
            Region:
            Category: build
            Provider: Jenkins  (this must match the provider you'll create in the Pipeline)
            Build Triggers:  Poll SCM
            Schedule: * * * * *
            Build:  
              Execute Shell: Command = rake
              Post-Buil Actions: AWS CodePipeline Publisher
                 Output Locations -> Add   (leave blank for codedeploy to place in s3)
         
        - Connect to AWS CodePipeline & Create New PL
           Name: JenkinsPL
           
           Source
               Source Provider: GitHub
               Repository: GitHub -> Connect
                 select repo
                 mstr branch
               output artifact: MyApp
           
           Build            
               Build Provider: Add Jenkins
                -Proivder name     <this must match that in the Jenkins project)
                - Server URL: <servers IP>                
                - Project name: BuildProject   <this is the jenkin's project name>
               Input Artifact: MyApp
               Ouput Artifact: MyAppBuild
           
           Deployment
             Action Category: Deploy
             Deplymt Provider: AWS CodeDeploy
             App Name: DemoApp    (This is the CodeDeploy App name)
             Dep Group: DemoAppinstances   ( This is the App Instance name of the CodeDeploy App)
             Role name: AWS-CodePipeline-Service (created previously)
             Input artifact: MyAppBuild
           
           CreatePL

  

  IV.V Adding a Test Stage to the Pipeline
    - See the project in Github and notice the Rake file includes a test section that calls a Ruby script
    
    - Add a new project in Jenkins for the test stage
        Name: TestProject    Freestyle project
        Execute concurrent builds if necessary
        Source Code Mngt: AWS CodePipeline
        Category: Test
        Provider: Jenkins (same as previou s project)
        Build triggers: Poll SCM     * * * * *
        Build: Execute Shell
           Command:  TEST_IP_ADDRESS=<IP_OF_Instance> rake test
        Post-buil Actions:  AWS CodePipeline Publisher
              don't add an action. this is just to signal to codepipeline when it's done
        
    - Add a test stage to the Codepipeline
        Name: test
        Action Categorty: Test
        Anction Name: JenkinsTest
        Test provider: Jenkis
        ProjectName: TestProject
        Input artifacts:
           MyAppBuild
    
    - Save changes
       
      
     
  IV.VI Bootstrapping and Building Images
  
      -You want your instances to come online quickly during deployments.
      
      -Bare OS image vs an Image with everything baked into it
      
      -partially configured AMI is best of both worlds
      
      -How to create an AMI of a running instance
      
      -How to launch an instance from personal AMI
      
      - Netflix's animator let's you create an AMI on a volume directly, without needing a running instance
            https://github.com/taruntmr/aminator   open source
      
  

  
  IV.V Blue-green deployments
     -Diagram of an blue-green deployment using RT53 and ELB
        Use weighted routing
        Canary analysis
     -DNS record TTL. should be low
     -Elastic Beanstalk and Opsworks have features for Blue/Green deployments
     
     
     
     
     
  V  Automating Infrastructure with CloudFormation
     Download the official user guide for reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-ug.pdf
   
  V.I Introduction
      We'll learn how to create CF templates using JSON
      
      
  V.II CloudFormation Key Concepts
      JSON - CF templates are written in JSON
      Resource Relationships - You don't need to worry about dependencies
      Feedback -
         CF will give you detailed status of a build
         CF will roll back the entire deployment if for some reason one of the resources fails to get created
      Reusable - Templates are reusable
      Interactive - You can define your templates to be interactive if you like
      Automated
           
  
  V.III Understanding JSON
      Json has become more popular than XML
       The official JSON doc site:  http://www.json.org/

       You can find a JSON editor and a formatter by doing a google search
          www.cleancss.com/json-editor
          jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com
          
       JSON is made up of key-value pairs
       Example of a JSON doc
         {
            "name": "Michele",
            "shirt_color": "blue",
            "laptops": [
                {
                    "brand": "Lenovo",
                    "operating_system": "Ubuntu"
                },
                {
                    "brand": "Apple",
                    "operating_system": "OSX"
                }
            ],
            "has_a_dog": false,
            "items_on_desk": ["mug", "pen", "monitor"]
          }
          
          
          
  V.IV  Creating a Basic Template
        You can use a text editor to create your template.
        Or you can use an IDE like Eclipse for MAC.  You'll want to install the 
           AWS Tookit for Eclipse to give you intelisense.
        
        To get started: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/details/
        
        Open Aws -> cloudformation -> Design Template
          or
        http://jsoneditoronline.org
        
        Create a template to build a single EC2 instance and a Sec Group.  
           See it here: https://github.com/rcextreme/AWS_DevOps_Engineer/blob/master/Cloud_Form_%232_EC2wSecGrp
        
        Login to AWS and Launch a stack with this template
        
        
        
        
  V.V   Adding Parameters, Mappings and Outputs
          In this section we'll update our template to use Parameters and Mapping
          
          You add parameters to the template to avoid writing sensitive data such as passwords.
          It's pretty cool because this will cause a Form to Appear in CFormation where you can enter the value.
          
          Also you can add mappings as way to obtain values that depend on various things.  Mappings are sort of hash.
          
          We Added the following parameters to the template
             -KeyName
             -InstanceType
             -SSHLocation
          
          Also add a mapping function to determine the image ID.  We added two maps
             -AWSInstanceType2Arch
             -AWSRegionArch2AMI
          
          The new template can be found here: 
                https://github.com/rcextreme/AWS_DevOps_Engineer/blob/master/Cloud_Form_Templ_%233_MapsNOutputs
                
             
V.VI  Bootstrapping Applications (update a stack)
        This section shows how to perform Bootstrap actions using a resources Metadata in  Conjunction with User data.
        This leverages AWS::CloudFormation::Init  and cfn-hup.    cfn-hup runs as a daemon and it can sense when metadata has been 
        changed and it will automatically update the stack.
        
        To update a stack you make the required changees to the template. Then in the CF GUI you select the stack, select modify
        and upload the new template
        
        
        The template is found here:
          https://github.com/rcextreme/AWS_DevOps_Engineer/blob/master/Cloud_Form_Templ_%234_CreationPolicy
          
          
  
V.VII Waiting on Instances
      This section focuses on how to notify cloudformation that the Bootstratp tasks on the stack have completed.
      There are two ways to do this.  Using
         -WaitCondition    this is the old way
         -CreationPolicy with Timeout    this is the newer way


V.VIII   DependsOn and Conditional Resources
     
     DependsOn - You use Depends resource when you have dependecies, say an EC2 instance depends on a DB
     Conditions - These are conditions or tests you can write in your template to take action if an action.
     
     You can use the example in the cfn user guide.  It creates a CreateProdResources condition.  Then the MountPoint resource
     will be createed in the conditions is met, ie the EnvType parameter was set to prod.
     
         ....
         ....

         "Parameters" : {
         "EnvType" : {
         "Description" : "Environment type.",
         "Default" : "test",
         "Type" : "String",
         "AllowedValues" : ["prod", "test"],
         "ConstraintDescription" : "must specify prod or test."
         }
         },

         "Conditions" : {
         "CreateProdResources" : {"Fn::Equals" : [{"Ref" : "EnvType"}, "prod"]}
         },

         "Resources" : {
         "EC2Instance" : {
        API Version 2010-05-15
        146
        AWS CloudFormation User Guide
        Conditions
         "Type" : "AWS::EC2::Instance",
         "Properties" : {
         "ImageId" : { "Fn::FindInMap" : [ "RegionMap", { "Ref" : "AWS::Region" }, "AMI" ]}
         }
         },

         "MountPoint" : {
         "Type" : "AWS::EC2::VolumeAttachment",
         "Condition" : "CreateProdResources",
         "Properties" : {
         "InstanceId" : { "Ref" : "EC2Instance" },
         "VolumeId" : { "Ref" : "NewVolume" },
         "Device" : "/dev/sdh"
         }
         },

         ...
         ...
     

V.IX  Troubleshooting Failed Stacks
      
      Typically CF destroys all resources if there's an error
      To troubleshoot disable 'Rollback on failure' from the Advanced section.
      
      Then read logs in /var/log (linux)
 
 
 
 V.X  Creating Nested Templates
       When you're building large deployments the best practice is to break up your Templates intead of having a huge one.
       Then you create a master template from which you call the smaller templates
       
       Use the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack  resource to achieve this as described in the CFN User Guide.
       The video does not build out a template 
       
       An example from the course on how it's used
       https://github.com/rcextreme/AWS_DevOps_Engineer/tree/master
       
       I found this example:
       https://github.com/wjordan/aws-codepipeline-nested-stack
  
  
  V.XI  Custom resources
       For the exam you just need to know what custom resources are and why you'd use them
       -If you need to provision a resource that's not supported by CloudFormation natively
       -You can implement either a Lambda-backed on SNS-backed custom resource
       
       Example uses:
       -A stack needs to create a subscription to a third pary (google, facebook) for authentication
       -Sometimes it takes AWS a few months to get CloudFormation support for a new AWS service.  You can create a custom 
         resource till native support is released
 
 
 V.XI CloufFormation Best Practices
    - Don't embed credentials
    - Validate templates
    - Manage Everything from CloudFormation, including updates
    - Use constraints & AWS specific parameter types
    - Use nested stacks to reduce code duplication
    - use code review and store templates and version control

VI  Deploying Apps with Elastic Beanstalk

VI.I Intro

VI.II Elastic Beanstalk Key Concepts

     Beanstalk is a service that makes it easy to quickly deploy and manage apps and it takes 
     away the need to have a deep understanding about all the vaious infrastructure comonents 
     that go along with deploying a scaleable web app.
     
     
    -Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (Pass)
    -Service for deploying and scaling web apps and services
    -Is intended to provide Autoscaling, load balancing & health monitoring
    -Platform management and code deployment
    
    Notes:
    - you have access to the underyling resourcess (ec2 instances, etc) as opposed to RDS where you don't have root access
    - You can choose from a number of preconfigured platform like node.js or Ruby or Python or Java or .net.
    - Beanstalk integrates with cod pipeline
  
  
VI.III Deploying a Web App with Beanstalk
  
  Exercise:
    Beanstalk -> Create New Application
      Name: Demo
      Create Web Server
      Predefined Configuration: PHP
      Environment Type: Load Balancing Auto Scaling
      Source: Sample Application
      Env name: Demo Env
      Details: instance type, ec2 key pair, email address,  rolling update type
    Beanstalk will build a Cloudformation template from these selections and bring up a stack
    
    Once App is deployed you can:
      -release an update, rolling upgrade
      -view the web page
      -edit the setting: scaling, instances, notification
      -view monitoring, logs, alarms
      
      
 
VI.IV Working with the EB CLI
    Let's install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI.  I did this on a Centos7 box.  I couldn't get it to work on Ubuntu
    
    AWS Console -> EB ->  Installing the EBS CLI
    
    $ sudo yum install python-pip
    $ sudo yum install python-devel
    $ curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
    $ sudo python get-pip.py
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade --user awsebcli

     The instructor already has his application directory.  I think it came from aws user guide
     initialize your application directory
     $ eb init
       < provide answer to interactive menu >
       This will generate a .elasticbeanstalk dir
     
     Create an environment for the application
     $ eb create
       < this creates a zip archive of contents of folder and uploads it to s3 and deploy the app>
     $ eb open
       < this will open the app in a your default web browser >
     
     make a change to your app and deploy it
     $ < edit the index.php>
     $ eb deploy      to deploy latest code changes
       


VI.V  Advanced Environment Customization
     reference:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html
     -Courese is using a demo app call 'php-demo-app'
       cd php-demoo-app
     -You have to create a subfolder called '.ebextension' where you'll place the customization yaml files
     -Just look over the content of the yaml files.  They're similar to Cloud Formation



VI.VI Rolling & Blue-Green Deployments     
     For this section you need to have your EB app deployed.
     
     AWS -> EB -> [ select your app ] -> Configuration 
       Updates and Deployment -> select gear_icon
       
     Here you can see options for Rolling Deployment and ROlling Config Updates
          example of aa Config Update change is a different instance type or ssh keypair
     
     How to do a blue green deployment
        select the App in EB
        Then select Actions->Clone environment
        
        Meanwhile the is running, you can make a change to the index.php in your App
        create a zip archive of your update App dir
        Now select the v2 App in EB, and select Upload and Deploy to load new App version
        
        At this point you have two different App Envs. Go back to the top of you EB App
        select Swap URLS


VI.VII Working with Docker
        In EB you can deploy Apps of type: Python, PHP, Java, Ruby, IIS,  
        You can also create your own custom Docker image if your App uses some other framework
        
        Docker options
          Preconfigured containers: Java with Glassfish, etc 
          Generic: Single Container with Docker, Multicontainer with ECS
        
        Use dockerrun.aws.json to use containers in private repos. this file specifies: 
          -version number
          - file in S3 used to authenticate to a private repository
          - Ports to expose on the docker container
          - volume mapping
          - logging directory
       
       you can run 'docker login' to generate authentication file that gets stored in s3
       
       you can use the standard Dockerfile to generate your own docker image
          reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-getting-started.html
             this deploys 'game 2048' sample web app
          Remember that you only do this when you don't alread have an image in a private or public repo
