III. Understanding AWS Security Best Practices

III.I Introduction

III.II Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model 3min
    Lecture:
    -AWS manages phsical access to the data centers
    -AWS manages the individual services for uptime and access: Compute, Storage, Networking, Regions, AZs, Edge Locations
    -Customer manages
      -OS/Config, Firewall, Apps, Client Side Encrypting, server side encryption, Authentication and Access Control
      
      
III.III Enabling Security with IAM Users and Groups
    
    Exercise: Securing IAM
      -Login to AWS and complete the Security Status checks
      -Create a user account
      -Create and Admin Group and add user to account
      -Login using the user account
    
    Exam notes:
      -Don't use root account to login
      -Don't have SSH keys on root account
      -Try to assign permission to users via groups instead of adding a policy directly to the user
      -Try not to use the generic ADMIN policy.  Try to create specific permission policies for each user.

III.IV Using IAM Roles for EC2 Instances

    Exercise: Adding a Role on an EC2 instance
        -Create a role to interface with CloudWatch so instance can upload custom metric data.
          you could do this by providing the user keys to the CLoudWatch agent but it's not as secured
        -Launch an instance with the Role
        -Display the temporary access keys via the instances metadata
            # curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/CWRole
    
    Exam notes:
        -Roles can only be assigned during launch of an instance.
        -It's more secure to use roles instead of user Keys
        -the AWS cli and SDKs automatically are able to access keys provided by a role. So the API calls
          will be authenticated by default
        -You can develop a custom App that can use the temporary access keys provided by a Role.
        -Amazon throught the day refreshes the temporary access keys provided by a role.
          You can view these keys via the instance's metadata
          
        
III.V Following the Principle of Least Privilege with IAM Policies
    
    Exercise: Creating a restrictive/custom S3 policy
        -Display the S3FullAccess Policy
        -Modify this policy to allow only list&upload permision to a specific bucket
          from a specific IP address
        -Test this policy by uploading a file with 'aws s3 ls' and 'aws s3 cp'
    
    Exam notes:
        -Remember principle of Least Privilege

III.VI Enabling Multifactor Authentication
    
    Exercise: Enabling MFA
        

III.VII Implemting an IAM Password Policy 
    
    Exercise: Enable an IAM passowrd policy
        -Enable a policy an a user
        -Display the Security Token Service in the IAM Dashboard.  
        
    Exam notes:
        -Enable an IAM password policy if a user needs access to the AWZ Console
            For password complexity and expiration
        -If a password is expired a user can still use access keys. they're separate
        -Password xcomplexit setting aren't enforced on current password. Only on next 
         time password is set
        -Password expiration rules take effect immediately. 
        -You can download an IAM  Credentials Report to see details regarding user's passwords.
        -Security Token Service (STS) is what generates the temporary access keys for Roles
    

III.VIII Securing Access to EC2 Instances
        Lecture:
            -Let's review these practices so they're fresh in your mind for the Exam.
            -Implement Security Groups to restrict access to instances.  Use least access method
            -Amazon recommends that you lock down your security groups to a single source IP or 
              traffic from another security group
            -A common approach is to use a private Subnet if possible.  Then leverage a NAT GW 
              for patches, etc.  show diagram
            -You can set IP forwaring in your NAT GW to forward say port 22 to your instance.
              This way you're only broadcasting one IP address
            
        
        
III.IX Auditing Security with AWS Trusted Advisor
        Exercise: Using Trusted Advisor
            -Open TA and analyze the Dashboard for Recommended Actions
            -The TA dashboard has a page for each of these
                Cost Optimization
                Performance
                Security
                Fault Tolerance
        
        For Exam:
            -TA is designed to help you optimze AWS setting to:
                Reduce Cost
                Improve Performacne
            -TA has a list of FREE security check
            -TA has additional checks you can purchas
            -
            
            
III.X Module Summary: Understanding AWS Security Best Practices

    Lecture:
        Who can assume an IAM role
        - user in same account as IAM role
        - user in a different account as IAM role
        - EC2 instance
        - user from an external IDp (SAML or OpenID)
        
        STS is the key service that grants temporary access to Roles
        
        Trust Policy.  There are always two policies associated with a Role.  
        -A permission policy
        -Trust Policy - says who can use this role (ec2 inst or user)


IV. Implementing Delegation and Federation

IV.I Introduction

IV.II Taking a closer look at IAM roles
    
    Lecture:
        Who can see an IAM role
        - User in same account as IAM role
        - User in a different account than IAM role
        - Amazon EC2
        - User from an external Identity Provider IdP (SAML or OpenID)
    
        Security Token Service (STS) is responsible for handing out temporary credentials
    
        IAM Roles consists of two policies
        - A Permission policy : Specifies the access being granted
        - A trust policy : This says who can use this policy (EC2 instance, IAM user, 3rd party provider)    
    


IV.III Delegating access to resources in another AWS account
    
    Exercise: Cross account access - Switch to a Role as an IAM user
    
        - Create a Dev user and write down its IP
        - Using your root account, create an Admin role of type 'Cross Account Access'
           and assign it to the Dev user
        - Login as the Dev user and assume the Admin role
        


IV.IV AWS STS API Actions You Need to Know
    Lecture
        AWS STS API Actions
        - AssumeRole : Granting Role to EC2 instances, Cross account access
        - AssumeRolewith SAML : For corporate access when using AD, LDAP, etc
                This leverages an AD Federation Service
        -AssumeRolewithWebIdentity : Used with Idp such as Google, Facebook,etc
        -GetFederationToken:  Similar to AssumeRole but credential has longe lifetime (up to 12hr)

        Cognito - This is a service to help authenticate mobile apps.  It stores user settings
               and facilitates 
    


IV.V Corporate Identity Federation Use Cases
    
    Lecture:
        The two use cases for Corporate Identity Federation
        - Custom Identity Broker Application - uses AssumRole or GetFederationToekn API
        - SAML Compliant IdP - Uses AssumeRolewithSAML API
        
        show the diagrams for these two cases. from the security whitepaper
    
    
IV.VI Creating an AWS Managed Active Directory Service

    Exercise: Create an AD in AWS 
        -Create the Directory
        -Add the 'Access URL' to your directory to allow your AD users access to AwS console
        

IV.V Launching an EC2 Instance into Managed AD
    
    Exercise: Create an EC2 instance to manage your directory
        - Create a Role to grant SSM access, this permission is required to join a directory
        - Launch Windows instance selecting the option to join to AD
        - Add a bootstratp script to install the Management tools for AD
        

IV.VI Setting up Federated Access to the AWS Console
    
    Exercise: Manage your AD to grant console access to a user
        - Login to your windows instance using RDP
        - Run 'AD Users and Computers' as the directory admin to administer your AD
        - Create an AD user 'Dave'
        - Create a group called RO-Access and add the user 'Dave'
        - Back in AWS, select your AD and enable 'AWS Management Console'
          -Create the Role you'll map to a user
          -Add the AD you created to the Role
          
        

IV.VII Web Identity Federation and Amazon Cognito Identity

    Lecture:
        -Use Web ID federation to leverage existing iDP and avoid having to manage
          maintaining user ID. Show diagram
        -Amazon Cognito is a service that lets you store preferences for mobile Apps
          and helps you sync user data across mobile devices.
        -Cognito use Web ID Fed
        
        Know the Basic Authentication Flow with Cognito. Here the device needs to talk
        to Cognito as well as STS
        
        Know  Enhanced Auth with Cognito.  Here the device only talks to Cognito via
        the GetCredentialsForIdentity API and then Cognito calls talks to STS
        
                
        
        
IV.VIII Module Summary: Implementing delegation and federation
    



V. Protecting Data In-Flight and at Rest

V.I Introduction

V.II Protecting Data in Amazon S3

    How does Amazon protect data in S3
    - objects in S3 are stored on multiple devices across multiple data centers within a region
    - S3 service regularly verifies the integrity of data using checksums
       and if it detects data corruption it repairs it
    - You can enable version to store every version of an object
    
    Protection With Server Side Encryption
        -Amazon S3 Managed keys - S3 itself handles keys and encrypts/decrypts data
        -AWS KMS-Managed Keys   - Logs in CloudTrail when keys were used
        -Customer-provided keys - good way to gurantee that customer accessing data has the appropriate keys
    
    Protection with Client Side Encryption
    - KMS-Managed Customer Master key
    - Client side master key
    
    Protecting Data in Transit - This is done by default.  S3 uses SOAP over HTTPS connections
    
    
    Exercise: Enable SSE on an S3 upload operation
     - Select 'Details' on upload windows
     - click 'Use server side encrypt'
     - View your keys in IAM->KMS
     
        

V.III Working with Amazon EBS Volume Encryption
    
    When you select to encrypt an EBS vol Amazon uses a key from your KMS.  It'll use
    that same key to decrypt the vol and transfer data to the instance
    
    Exercise: Encrypting EBS Vols
        - Encrypt a volume at creation
            show the default key that gets created in KMS
        - Encrypt the root volume by creating an Encrypted AMI

    For exam:
        You can only encrypt a vol at time of creation
        A snap shot of an encrypted vol is encrypted
